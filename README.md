## Instagram Automatic Account Creator Bot

<p>This small piece of code will create an account automatically by randomizing names. You need Selenium library installed. This is an ongoing work. Beware that Instagram has security measures to prevent bot usage. Do not forget to change the Web driver you use from the part of the code:</p>

```Python
browser = webdriver.Chrome("your chrome driver path here")
```
Also, you can use other browsers with tweaking the code.
```Python
#Another browser
browser = webdriver.Firefox("your firefox driver path here")
```
